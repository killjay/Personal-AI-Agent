# AI Agent Meeting Scheduling Feature

June can now act as an intelligent AI agent to automatically schedule meetings when requested!

## ðŸ¤– How It Works

When you ask June to schedule a meeting, it:

1. **Understands Natural Language**: Uses GPT-OSS model (Hugging Face) to extract meeting details from your voice command
2. **Asks for Clarification**: If critical information is missing, June will ask you to provide it
3. **Creates Calendar Events**: Automatically adds the meeting to your Google Calendar
4. **Sends Invitations**: Can send email invites to attendees if email addresses are provided

## ðŸŽ¤ Voice Commands Examples

### Complete Requests
- *"June, schedule a meeting with John tomorrow at 2pm"*
- *"Schedule a 30 minute call with Sarah for Friday"*
- *"Set up a team meeting next week"*
- *"Book a meeting with alex@company.com for tomorrow at 10am"*

### Partial Requests (June will ask for clarification)
- *"Schedule a meeting with John"* â†’ June asks: "When would you like to schedule it?"
- *"Set up a meeting for tomorrow"* â†’ June asks: "Who would you like to meet with?"

## ðŸ§  AI Intelligence Features

### **Smart Detail Extraction**
June understands various ways of expressing meeting details:
- **Time**: "tomorrow", "next week", "Friday at 2pm", "Monday morning"
- **Duration**: "30 minute call", "hour-long meeting", "quick 15 minute check-in"
- **Attendees**: Names, email addresses, or groups like "team meeting"

### **Missing Information Handling**
If you don't provide enough details, June intelligently asks for the missing information:
- Missing attendee: *"I need to know who you want to meet with"*
- Missing time: *"When would you like to schedule it?"*

### **Smart Defaults**
- **Default duration**: 60 minutes if not specified
- **Default time**: 2:00 PM if only date is provided
- **Auto-scheduling**: Finds the next occurrence of requested day/time
